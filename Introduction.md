Welcome to the **World of Clouds**!

 As of now, many startups have been started in this world or near your city or in your city...
Every tech company will maintain a server to store their company's data or to store their employees' details or something about the project they were working on So they don't save these things in a hard drive on a PC. For this Database, they will maintain a server for the data. For example, almost all schools and colleges will maintain a server to store their student record for future use so for that server they will use on_premises which is nothing but they will buy the servers from a server manufacturer(Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Cisco Systems) and deploy in their own space because they will maintain it only for database
