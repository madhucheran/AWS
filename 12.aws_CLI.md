## **Intro**
- **CLI** - Command Line Interface

- As we see we can able to make the service available through the GUI in web Browser.

- And that is very convinient for everyone 

- But sometimes, especially when you are working on a - Infrastructure Management the GUI will not the perfect decision

- AWS UI is not Automation friendly

- As a AWS Administrator or a Devops Engineer you may need to know about the **CLI** - Command Line Interface.

## **API**
- **API** - Application Programming Interface.
- By using the API we can able to communicate with the server from our application without opening a browser and navigating.

### **Why to use API?**
---
- By  using an API, you don't have to write code from scratch every time you need a specific functionality. You just need to call the appropriate API.
- For example if we need to create 10 vpc within in 30 minutes then by using GUI it will take at least 2 hours.
- But with the help of API and CLI we can able to create it within the given time.
- AWS provide a wide range of APIs which are well documented.

**Tools using with API**
- AWS CLI
- Terraform
- Cloud Formation Templates
- Cloud Development Kit (**CDK**)
    - These are the popular tools for automate infrastructure on AWS

### Create
- For creating a vpc or S3 bucket like in 30 minutes We should write a code for creating this S3 bucket.
- But don't worry we no need to write the code from scratch.
- The IAS (Infrastructure as Code) provides the templates for creating resources.
- By using these templates you just have to pass the parameters and It will create the resources for you.
- Example Languages for IAS
    - yaml, json, cdk(Javascript), python, typescript etc.,

- For that we need to install the Abstraction from the IAS providers
- We just need to know how to install and how to pass the parameters and how to read the documents.
